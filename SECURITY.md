## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in AvoRed Rust CMS, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@avored.com] (if available) or create a private GitHub security advisory
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Do NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies using `cargo update`
   - Run `cargo audit` before releases
   - Use `cargo deny` to check licenses and security advisories

2. **Code Security**
   - Follow Rust security guidelines
   - Use secure coding practices
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

3. **Environment Security**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use strong, unique passwords and API keys

### For Deployment

1. **Server Security**
   - Keep the operating system updated
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Regular security audits

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Implement database access controls
   - Regular database backups
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest

3. **Application Security**
   - Configure security headers
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use secure session management
   - Regular security monitoring

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Password Hashing**: Uses Argon2 for secure password storage
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses SurrealDB with parameterized queries

### Security Headers

The application should be configured with the following security headers:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Security Scanning

### Automated Scanning

We use the following tools for automated security scanning:

- **cargo-audit**: Vulnerability scanning for Rust dependencies
- **cargo-deny**: License and security policy enforcement
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for code vulnerabilities
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Manual Security Reviews

- Code reviews for all security-related changes
- Regular penetration testing
- Security architecture reviews
- Third-party security audits (when applicable)

## Incident Response

### In Case of a Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the incident
   - Document all actions taken

2. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Coordinate with security researchers
   - Prepare public disclosure

3. **Recovery**
   - Deploy fixes
   - Monitor for additional issues
   - Conduct post-incident review
